Default: 8080
_Description: TCP Port where Kolibri will be available
 The default is 8080, other possible options are 80 and 8008.
 For example, if Kolibri is installed and started on a computer with the
 IP address 192.168.0.104, you can access it from an Android tablet connected
 to the same network by opening the browser on the tablet and typing
 the address http://192.168.0.104:8080.
 .
 Entering a port that is already in use in the server will make Kolibri
 can't start.
